          <p>Green Diwali is a way of celebrating the festival of lights with minimum damage to the environment. The idea is simple, we have to save the environment and mother Earth, which provides us all the natural resources.Here are some important points from which we can celebrate green diwali-</p>
        <p id ="reason1">1.Avoid using electric lights to illuminate your home. Instead, opt for diyas (earthen lamps) and candles. This saves electricity.</p>
          <p> 2.Limit usage of firecrackers that emit enormous smoke and sound.</p>
          <p>3.Dispose off waste properly after celebrations.</p>
          <p>4.Select eco-friendly gifts and decorating items.</p>
          <p>What will happen if we celebrate red diwali and not green diwali? Here are some points which will occur if we celebrate red diwali-
            <p>1.The poisonous chemical mix discharged from fire crackers affect people with asthma and other respiratory disorders and persons who have multiple chemicals sensitivity.</p>
        <p>2.Studies have shown that fire crackers have significant amount of heavy metals such as lead and cadmium and their fumes contain oxides of sulphur, phosphorous, nitrogen and carbon, which are highly harmful. </p>
